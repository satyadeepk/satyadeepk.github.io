<p>This is a gift from my beloved friend <em><strong>Madhava Krishna</strong></em> on my Birthday! Thank you very much my dear for the lovely poem :D</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>My dearÂ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/satyadeepk" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/user.php?id=100000298309056">Satyadeep</a>...</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>The life ahead is like a heap</em><br />
<em> which is very steep,</em><br />
<em> on which some times you should creep,</em><br />
<em> and go deep......</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Hope you never bleep and weep,</em><br />
<em> and always sweep and reap</em><br />
<em> the things in the creepy heap,</em><br />
<em> if necessary, take a leap,</em><br />
<em> have a good sleep,</em><br />
<em> and keep your life as happy as a journey in a jeep,</em><br />
<em> but never make yourself cheap.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Many many happy returns of the day Karnati Satyadeep.. :)</em></p>
