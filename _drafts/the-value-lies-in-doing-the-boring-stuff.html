<div>What do all softwares achieve? Automation</p>
<div>What does automation mean? To automate the mechanical and mundane tasks so that we can concentrate on what really matters.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Take any good productivity software for example: Dropbox, Gmail etc. They do all the boring stuff of syncing our files and delivering our emails so we can focus on more important things.</div>
<div></div>
<div>So, when you do all the boring stuff and let your user feel that she is in control, then you generate value. When the computer does what you want it to do like a genie, then you feel powerful.</div>
