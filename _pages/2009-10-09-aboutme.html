<p>Hi,<img class="alignright" title="Satyadeep" alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/saty1.jpg" width="230" height="288" /><br />
This is <strong>Satyadeep Karnati</strong>. I am a web and mobile developer, photographer, cyclist, music lover and a foodie!</p>
<p>I did my B.Tech in Computer Science And Engineering (Class of 2012), at <a href="http://www.iitg.ernet.in">IIT Guwahati</a>.</p>
<p>I am interested in web and Android app development and like to build cool stuff, getting my hands dirty with code. I want to build awesome applications which improve people's lives.</p>
<p>I am a web addict and tech freak and  want to share my experiences and<br />
resourceful findings - some of which I learnt  after hours of struggle.</p>
<p>I am also interested in Photography and love to take interesting shots. When I am not writing code or shooting photos, you can find me on my cycle  breezing through the city roads!</p>
<p>Feel free to browse through the blog.</p>
