<p>Do Pdf is a useful tool I have found for converting any type of document which is printable into a PDF. It is fairly light weight converter and output file size is considerably reduced with quality remaining mostly intact.</p>
<p>It nicely integrates as a virtual printer driver, so you just need to click print of the file and select DoPdf instead of regular printer. You can also select several images at once and click on print to create single PDF from the images. This would be useful when merging a scanned text book images into a PDF.</p>
