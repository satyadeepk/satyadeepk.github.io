<p>If you have by an accident skimmed through my blog, you would have already realized that I am a big fan of <a title="Tour Of Dropbox" href="https://www.dropbox.com/tour" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>. Here's one more tip for Dropbox power users.</p>
<p>Ever thought, it would be nice if you can email files to your Dropbox. You may have several reasons for that</p>
<ul>
<li>Directly send files from your smart phone to Dropbox just by a mail</li>
<li>Request a person without dropbox to send files to your Dropbox</li>
<li>Perform automated <a title="WP-DB-Backup" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-db-backup/" target="_blank">database backup</a> of your Wordpress blog to Dropbox!</li>
<li>..........missed something? Drop in a comment!</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://sendtodropbox.com" target="_blank">Send To Dropbox</a></span> is a third party Dropbox app which achieves this functionality using the Dropbox API.  You just need to connect your Dropbox account with Send To Dropbox, just like a twitter or facebook application - No password business! After authentication, it gives you a unique email id to which you can send the attachments to. Thats it! Any mail sent to this email will directly land in the new "Attachments" folder in your Dropbox.</p>
<p>You can also change settings to dump files in organized way - For example sorted by subject, or day as shown below. The app also has an option to automatically decompress .zip archives before putting into your Dropbox.</p>

<p>If you don’t know what <a title="Tour of Dropbox" href="https://www.dropbox.com/tour" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> is, it is a popular file synchronization and backup tool which automatically syncs all your computers which are linked to your Dropbox to the cloud. It also gives a 2 GB free online storage space which can be expanded to a whopping 10 GB.</p>
