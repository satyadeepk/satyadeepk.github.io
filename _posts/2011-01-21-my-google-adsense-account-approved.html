<p>Finally, after some attempts, my Google <a href="http://google.com/adsense" target="_blank">Adsense</a> account has been approved - meaning I can monetize the site. But I have no hope of getting something out of it in the next few years as I can only receive a check if my earnings reach $100.  Lets see if I can manage to get some traffic converted into clicks, which I think is far from reality  :P</p>
