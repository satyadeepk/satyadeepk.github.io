<p><img class="alignright" title="youtube" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/youtube.png" alt="" width="116" height="48" />Sometimes, we would like to save Youtube videos to our computer for watching them later. There are many <a title="Video Download helper" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/" target="_blank">download managers </a>and helpers to do this on different platforms. But if you are using Firefox on Ubuntu, there is a simpler way without any hassles of using plugins.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the video on the youtube page normally and allow it to buffer completely.</li>
<li>Open the directory <strong>/tmp</strong> in which the flash video is actually cached. You will notice a file something like say "<strong>FlashXXQ4xGrX</strong>".</li>
<li>After the video is completely buffered, copy the file from <strong>/tmp</strong> to your directory and rename it like <strong>something.flv</strong></li>
<li>That's it and you are done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many a times, the Mozilla Firefox cache is not stored in <strong>/tmp</strong> but in the folder like <em>/home/user/.mozilla/firefox/<strong>your_profile</strong>/Cache. </em>This is a hidden folder and use<strong> Ctrl+H</strong> to make it visible in the File manager. A lot of files are stored in the Cache folder and sort the files on DateModified to trace the right one.</p>
