<p>Way back in the winter of January, when we just returned from our homes for the final semester of our four delightful years at  <a title="Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati" href="http://www.iitg.ac.in">IIT Guwahati</a>. I was fascinated towards photography for quite a long time and wished to try my hand at it, but was limited by the fact that I do not have a camera. But this time, being the last semester I didn't want my campus memories to just fade away and got the modest <a title="Sony DSC-S750" href="http://store.sony.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;partNumber=DSCS750">Sony DSC-S750</a> point and shoot camera along with me.</p>
<p>Then one fine afternoon, the weather turned cloudy and it suddenly started raining. Luckily, I always carry the camera with me just in case any interesting stuff turns up.  Then I realized it was the perfect time for me to start exploring my surroundings as everything looked brilliant just after the rain. Though, initially I was shy about taking photos in public, I tried to overcome this by going out with a group of friends instead of me trying out alone.</p>
<p>So when I was looking for some scenes which capture the mood of the weather, I was fascinated by this park bench which was wet by the tiny droplets of the rain. I positioned the cam to get this perspective and I was amazed by the kind of quality and the shallow depth of field produced by my tiny 7.2 MP point &amp; shoot cam. I found the macro mode to be particularly alluring as it opened up a whole new micro-world for me. I went on exploring more close up shots ranging from flowers to insects and weeds, each one of them looking fresh and vibrant after the downpour. I will be posting those soon and this is first in this series of my hand at some <a title="My PhotoLog " href="http://satyadeepk.in/category/photography/">Photography </a>stuff. Stay tuned!!</p>
